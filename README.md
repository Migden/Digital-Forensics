### Purpose
---------------
The purpose of the REPO is to store information regarding the `Digital Forensics` unit from TAFE Advanced Diploma. This includes, scripts, information, images etc.

### Scripts
----------

#### ChromeHistory.py
-----------------
This script has been developed to enhance my understanding of the locations for important information regarding URL history in the Chrome Web Browser

##### About the script (Justification)
When I write a program I like to justify the use of certain technologies over others. And to gain more understanding the usescases and purposes of technologies

1. Object Orrientation
   The use of object orientation has been used in my sscript to allow for more modules to be imported into the class that conduct futher analysis. It allows me to keep more control over the
   class variables and modules. It also removes the practice of using mulitple parameters in class functions and instead replaces it with the `self` object allowing for greater readability
   and less violations of the DRY principle

2. SubProccesses Module
   The subporccesses module was used to execute commands on the windows system and to discover the username of the user running the script.

### Future Additions
------------
In the future I will be adding more modules to allow more information to be pulled from the Chrome history data such as Time-Visited or find the most common URL typed.
